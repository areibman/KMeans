This is a java application. To use, run Main.java within src with all other files in their appropriate places. 

You will be asked to give 3 inputs: The file containing the frequencies, the minimum support count, and the file containing the output. For the input and output, I recommend using .dat files as they are formatted well for the task. For output, I recommend using .txt . An example of an input would be iris.dat and an output would be output.iris .

Any java IDE environment should work, but IntelliJ is preferred. 

Refer to output.txt for a what the output would look like for the specified document
